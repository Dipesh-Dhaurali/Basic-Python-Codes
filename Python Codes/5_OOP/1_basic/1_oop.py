Class is the blueprint of creating objects.
Class keyword is use to creating class.
Class name is always start with capital letters.
         Example: class Student:


Example i make a blue print of the car which refers to the class,
and i completely made a car which is object.

The basic idea of OOP is user class and objects
to represent real world entities.

Class is a blueprint or templete for creating objects.
It defines the proporties and methods that an object
of that class will have.

An object is an instances of the class and it contains
its own data and method.

For example you could create a class called
"Person" that has proporties such as name ,
age , methods etc such as speak() and walk().
- Each instance of the person class would be a unique object
- with its own name and age , but they would all have
the same methods to speak and walk.
