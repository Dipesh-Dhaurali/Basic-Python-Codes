"""
1) Polymorphism in Python means "one instance, many forms." â€” 
just like a person named Ram can be a 
student at school, 
a son at home, and a friend in class, 
the same object in Python can behave 
differently depending on the context 
in which it is used.



2) Polymorphism in Python means "many forms," 
allowing the same function or 
method name to work in 
different ways depending on the 
object it is acting on.



3) The real example of Polymorphism in Python
is operator overloading.
like
----
print(1+2)  #add
print("hello"+"world") #concat
print([1,2,3] + [4,5,6]) #merge
