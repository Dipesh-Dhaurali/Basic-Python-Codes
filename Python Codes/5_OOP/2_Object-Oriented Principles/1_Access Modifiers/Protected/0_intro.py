"""
 Note:
The term "protected" is used to describe members of a class that are intended
to be accessed only by the class itself and its subclasses.

In Python, this is done by prefixing the name with a single underscore (_).
For example, if a class has a method called _my_method, it indicates that
the method is intended for internal or subclass use only.
This is just a convention and not enforced by Python (unlike in some other languages).
