# note
# 1) i is just a variable which is not related to range
# 2) i is not compulsory to assign value like i=1
# 3) range default start value is 0
# 4) range default step value is 1
# 5) range strop value is always (n-1){ if we enter 6 than it goes upto 5}
# 6) stop is compulsory to give in range function
